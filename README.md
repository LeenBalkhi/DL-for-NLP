# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (DL4NLP)

This repository contains the coursework and projects developed as part of the "Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" module in the MSc in Artificial Intelligence program. Universit√§t Passau

## Overview

The DL4NLP course focuses on applying deep learning techniques to various NLP tasks. It covers fundamental concepts, model architectures, and practical implementations using popular deep learning frameworks.

## Course Topics

* Different tokenization approaches
* Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
* Feedforward Neural Networks
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTM
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for text
* Attention Mechanisms and Transformers
* Sequence-to-Sequence Models
* Pre-trained Language Models 
* Text Classification, and Sentiment Analysis


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyTorch or TensorFlow
* Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeenBalkhi/DL-for-NLP.git
   cd DL-for-NLP
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Navigate to the exercise directory to explore various NLP models and their implementations. Each exercise folder contained a notebook that is self-contained and includes explanations and code examples.
